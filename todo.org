  As a minimum pixel count * multiplier
  could also have some metric for how clumped together, grouped, spreadout the pixels are
  Maybe some metric based on a traveling salesman heuristic?

* Brightness cutoff
  int or (int, int, int) where int in [0, 255]
  x is converted to (x, x, x)


  If all channels are brighter than cutoff it will be ignored
